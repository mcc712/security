Date: May 10, 2023
Asset: Blockchain
Risk: N/A
Status: Resolved
Reference: https://github.com/cascadiafoundation/cascadia/releases
Description: Cascadiad v0.1.2 has been moved to latest release.  Upgrade instructions are available at https://cascadia.gitbook.io/gitbook/validators/install-your-node/upgrade-your-node.  Cascadia is a highly modified blockchain built on Tendermint architecture.  On May 6, 2023, a nilpointer reference was received w/i cascadia/x/gov/keeper/tally.go, resulting from Cosmos SDK governance module customizations.  Consequently, rewardkeeper functionalities were added and evm calls were removed w/i cascadia/x/reward/keeper/evm.go.  An opportunity presented itself to conduct additional upgrades, in particular relating to slashing penalty redirection.  However, after discussion w/ the community, going forward, testing will no longer be conducted on devnet w/o prior notice, which will now function as a "production" chain.  A duplicate "staging" chain has been spooled up for internal pre-releases to ensure stability.  Quite frankly, we've been both honored and stunned at the public's interest in Cascadia and have essentially come to the realization that we require a devnet for our devnet, since our building process is now so public.  As always, we're incredibly thankful for your patience and support, and are especially grateful to the systemd team, as well as AlxVoy ANODE, CroutonDigital, crytobtcbuyer, Crypton, F5 Nodes, ksalab, genznodes, GNST, Hexnodes, inmenta, Jesus, Lapatylin, Lefey, Lesnik | UTSA, MONADA, 1ce, Nodeist, NODEJUMPER, rch, roadz, semio11111, SNSMLN, Stake-Take, STAKEME, STAVR, and STC Capital, for helping us reach consensus.
