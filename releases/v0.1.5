Title: v0.1.5
Date: September 1, 2023
Asset: Blockchain
Priority: Normal
Risk: Low
Reference: https://github.com/cascadiafoundation/cascadia/releases
Notes: Cascadia v0.1.5 integrates the Twilight release of Cosmos SDK (version 0.47), bringing a number of changes to the platform to improve functionality and performance.  Notably, Cascadia will now integrate CometBFT, recently launched as a fork to Tendermint Core.  As part of this upgrade, CometBFT v0.37 will replace Tendermint Core as Cascadia's state machine replication engine.   Another key feature to be implemented in this upgrade will be ABCI 1.0 integration.  This introduces methods such as "prepareProposal” and “processProposal’’, allowing for more efficient and flexible communication between the application and the consensus engine.  Finally, a new App-side mempool will be added, enabling applications to implement custom block construction and mempools.
